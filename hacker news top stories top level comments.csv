At a glance it helps orient the data on screen in context of the larger dataset.<p>The helix I find hard to read and not useful. These types of graphs are better suited for periodic data where the period is much shorter than the span of the dataset.<p>The cube made me curious, but I couldn&#x27;t quite see the advantage. Usually using a 3D viz is not as effective as using three 2D equivalent graphs (here would be 3 scatter plots) -- simply because the projection from 3D to 2D distorts things and messes with our innate ability to compare locations (and a bit less so, areas). What was the effect you were after here?",,41088013,,[41088771],,,,,
