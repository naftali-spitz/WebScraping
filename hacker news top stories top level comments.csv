Almost 50 years since email was invented and 35 years since HTML was born. A &#x27;basic-open-source-HTML-email-designer&#x27; must be a solved problem, right? We thought so too.<p>Sadly, that&#x27;s not the case.<p>There are a few decent open source email designers but they carry dependencies that make them cumbersome to embed within your app. That&#x27;s why we decided to open source our HTML Email Designer.<p>The SENDUNE email designer focuses on simplicity and ease of use. It is light-weight. It does pure HTML - no intermediate code wranglers like mjml. There is no lock-in of any kind.

41011877,,story,joshsymbols,2024-07-19 22:05:50,"Hey devs :)
With 15+ years of UI kit building &amp; design systems, my team is launching a platform that allows developers to build consistent &amp; fully functional UI kits &#x2F; web projects in days, instead of months. Giving you best practices with the most advanced system design&#x2F;system design for reusing UI components, combined with access to 500+ open-source components that you can build anything with.<p>Yes it’s open source tech with no vendor lock. Which means you can export any part of your UI kit &#x2F; project at anytime. Our goal isn’t to enhance your tech stack, not to lock you in.<p>Anyways, why should you care?<p>Well first what are the problems we are trying to solve, and how can we possibly build a UI kit this fast?<p>Reusability and consistency being the umbrella challenges that devs face on a daily basis.<p>For example, a few common issues…<p>- How do I rebrand my entire component library for a new project that has a totally different set of branding requirements? - Collaborating with non-developers such as designers on available properties (colour tokens) to use is a pain - How do I easily organise and inspect my library, to avoid rebuilding components that are already available (especially as a team) If the component has too many properties, it becomes hard to scale and reuse. Therefore encourages new components being made, which degrades the efficiency of the design system - While component libraries such as Tailwind and Bootstrap are good off the shelf component libraries, they are typically hard and time consuming to customise to your own personal requirements, because they are built for certain use cases and styling - The rise in design system and documentation tools such as Storybook and Zero height solve part of these issues, which is mainly communication. However the effectiveness of a design system is based on the system design itself, which non of these offer. Therefore requiring you to still spend huge amounts of time and money developing a system that promotes reusability across your entire UI kit and design system code architecture.<p>How does Symbols solve this challenges?<p>A few key points…<p>- Aside from 500+ components being provided for you to build whatever you want, you can build are 100% customisable components. The properties can easily be override anytime - Review and organise your component library into tags, to avoid building existing ones - A highly advanced design system that does the heavy lifting of complex tasks at the code level, such as auto generated type scale for both typography and spacing. This makes creating responsive design much easier, as you no-longer have to set-up the spacing sequence for each component. Apply global design changes such as dark mode across entire library and more Use and fetch tokens across your entire UI kit, which significantly reduces the lines of code = code becomes more reusable and scalable - Easily build, test, document any part of your project in isolation, including functions, pages, individual components and the colours in your designs system - Rebrand your entire UI kit&#x2F; project with automatic spacing&#x2F;responsive changes, just by reconfiguring the design system menu - With real-time collaboration and no-code &#x2F; low-code tools, you can build your project with other developers and non-developers at the same time - Avoid having to setup and maintain multiple design system tools &#x2F; documents, as the platforms UX is setup to easily view your project as the documentation across all tech&#x2F;non-tech teams -Changes seen instantly to dev version of web project, before publishing to production<p>This month, we add canvas mode to the platform. Making Symbols, “Figma for developers”, with your entire functional&#x2F;animated&#x2F;interactive UI kits being available on a canvas.<p>Here is a quick landing page I put together (I’m the marketing founder) that showcases Symbols in action via videos.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;symbolsapp.framer.website&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;symbolsapp.framer.website&#x2F;</a>",,,,"[41018377, 41016344]",https://symbolsapp.framer.website/,11,Show HN: We made a platform that allows you to build UI kits in days not months,,4

40998497,,story,oshams,2024-07-18 18:40:14,"TL;DR: Vector-based RAG performs poorly for many real-world applications like codebase chats, and you should consider &#x27;language maps&#x27;.<p>Part of our mission at Mutable.ai is to make it much easier for developers to build and understand software. One of the natural ways to do this is to create a codebase chat, that answer questions about your repo and help you build features.<p>It might seem simple to plug in your codebase into a state-of-the-art LLM, but LLMs have two limitations that make human-level assistance with code difficult:<p>1. They currently have context windows that are too small to accommodate most codebases, let alone your entire organization&#x27;s codebases.<p>2. They need to reason immediately to answer any questions without thinking through the answer &quot;step-by-step.&quot;<p>We built a chat sometime a year ago based on keyword retrieval and vector embeddings. No matter how hard we tried, including training our own dedicated embedding model, we could not get the chat to get us good performance.<p>Here is a typical example: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;mutableai&#x2F;article&#x2F;1813815706783490055&#x2F;media&#x2F;1813813912472870913"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;mutableai&#x2F;article&#x2F;1813815706783490055&#x2F;media&#x2F;18...</a><p>If you ask how to do quantization in llama.cpp the answers were oddly specific and seemed to pull in the wrong context consistently, especially from tests. We could, of course, take countermeasures, but it felt like a losing battle.<p>So we went back to step 1, let’s understand the code, let’s do our homework, and for us, that meant actually putting an understanding of the codebase down in a document — a Wikipedia-style article — called Auto Wiki. The wiki features diagrams and citations to your codebase. Example: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;ggerganov&#x2F;llama.cpp"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;ggerganov&#x2F;llama.cpp</a><p>This wiki is useful in and of itself for onboarding and understanding the business logic of a codebase, but one of the hopes for constructing such a document was that we’d be able to circumvent traditional keyword and vector-based RAG approaches.<p>It turns out using a wiki to find context for an LLM overcomes many of the weaknesses of our previous approach, while still scaling to arbitrarily large codebases:<p>1. Instead of context retrieval through vectors or keywords, the context is retrieved by looking at the sources that the wiki cites.
2. The answers are based both on the section(s) of the wiki that are relevant AND the content of the actual code that we put into memory — this functions as a “language map” of the codebase.<p>See it in action below for the same query as our old codebase chat:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;mutableai&#x2F;article&#x2F;1813815706783490055&#x2F;media&#x2F;1813814321144844288"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;mutableai&#x2F;article&#x2F;1813815706783490055&#x2F;media&#x2F;18...</a><p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;mutableai&#x2F;article&#x2F;1813815706783490055&#x2F;media&#x2F;1813814363939315712"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;mutableai&#x2F;article&#x2F;1813815706783490055&#x2F;media&#x2F;18...</a><p>The answer cites it sources in both the wiki and the actual code and gives a step by step guide to doing quantization with example code.<p>The quality of the answer is dramatically improved - it is more accurate, relevant, and comprehensive.<p>It turns out language models love being given language and not a bunch of text snippets that are nearby in vector space or that have certain keywords! We find strong performance consistently across codebases of all sizes. The results from the chat are so good they even surprised us a little bit - you should check it out on a codebase of your own, at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai</a>, which we are happy to do for free for open source code, and starts at just $2&#x2F;mo&#x2F;repo for private repos.<p>We are introducing evals demonstrating how much better our chat is with this approach, but were so happy with the results we wanted to share with the whole community.<p>Thank you!",,,,"[41002519, 41005459, 41006901, 41008857, 41002509, 41003540, 41002186, 41007804, 41004504, 41007176, 41010607, 41009526, 41001922, 41001803, 41005645, 41007796, 41007586, 41001942, 40999031, 40999863, 41002469, 41015575]",https://twitter.com/mutableai/status/1813815706783490055,154,Show HN: How we leapfrogged traditional vector based RAG with a 'language map',,52

Originally, I&#x27;m an iOS developer, but over time, I became interested in CLI and DevEx, which ultimately led to the creation of my first CLI utility in Swift.<p>Project creation story:
I enjoy interactive and functional command-line interfaces with good UX, which often includes beautifully displaying the progress of ongoing operations. I wanted the ability to show a nice progress status for any command or script, but at the time, I couldn&#x27;t find any solutions that suited my needs. Most community offerings are good libraries for specific programming languages. So, I decided this was the perfect moment to test my skills and Swift&#x27;s capabilities in writing CLI utilities.<p>In my opinion, Swift did an excellent job (although it doesn&#x27;t have as rich a set of relevant libraries as Rust, for example).<p>The main challenge turned out to be cross-platform support:<p>- Currently (Swift 5.10), Swift doesn&#x27;t support full cross-compilation, making it impossible to build a Linux version on macOS. However, this capability will be available in Swift 6! This limitation forced me to use Docker, slightly complicating the release flow.<p>- Unlike macOS, Linux doesn&#x27;t come with pre-installed Swift libraries (obviously), so they need to be embedded (statically linked) into the binary file, which significantly increases its size, even after stripping. I hope the strip process will become more efficient in the future.<p>Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the result and would be thrilled if my small utility proves useful to others. :)",,,,"[41004481, 41009271, 41002431, 41008254, 41015495, 41004524]",https://github.com/kattouf/ProgressLine,28,Show HN: ProgressLine – Track commands progress in a compact one-line format,,14

Boards are flexible tables that help you structure and make sense of data that lives in PDFs, pictures and more.<p>Many business users spend time extracting key information from files like invoices, contracts and other documents. Boards eliminate the need for this by focussing on 3 things:
1. Flexibility: boards can be easily tailored to suit your business. Start from a template or create a board from scratch.
2. Automating data entry: to import information into your board, simply upload files or email your board.
3. Simplifying change: when a business process changes, we make it super easy to add columns to your board and backfill them.<p>We believe software of the future is truly custom and boards are built with this principle in mind. Some of the things you can use boards for:
- Tracking supplier payments
- Customer orders
- Managing contracts and agreements<p>Check out the product demo here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;8893fd608ab842c39298db7a93a640f7"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;8893fd608ab842c39298db7a93a640f7</a>",,,,"[41015293, 40991258, 40992454, 40993124, 40990162, 40990573]",https://www.kili.so/,36,Show HN: Boards – Automate document-heavy tasks,,11

I created a note-taking website for electronics and circuits where you can draw circuit diagrams and write text notes at the same time.<p>I am a Digital IC designer, and I self-study different types of analog and digital circuits a lot. However, I found a problem. Circuits have many different architectures and are hard to memorize due to numerous experiential tips. I want to document what I learn in my note app, but I found there is no method for me to easily draw circuit and block diagrams alongside text notes.<p>This issue has bothered me for a long time, from my master&#x27;s school to my current working life. I decided to solve it, so I created a note-taking website specifically for electronics and circuits, called VisCircuit.<p>With VisCircuit, you can easily draw circuit diagrams, block diagrams, and write text notes simultaneously. I have already used it for two weeks and have noted down things I find hard to remember, such as SRAM, amplifier circuits, and PCB components of Arduino and Raspberry Pi. I found this tool really useful for memorizing knowledge about electronics and circuits.<p>Currently, I have opened VisCircuit for alpha testing, and I want to let some people use it and give me feedback. Feel free to try it, and I will really appreciate what you think about this project. Leave any suggestions for improvement.

We help teams understand when their LLM apps are failing or hallucinating at scale. See a demo: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.traceloop.com&#x2F;video"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.traceloop.com&#x2F;video</a> or try it yourself at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.traceloop.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;demo"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.traceloop.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;demo</a>.<p>When moving your LLM app to production, significant scale makes it harder for engineers and data scientists alike to understand when their LLM is hallucinating or returning malformed responses. When you get to millions of calls to OpenAI a month, methods like “LLM as a judge” can’t work at a reasonable cost or latency. So, what most people we talked to usually do is sample some generations by hand, maybe for some specific important customers, and manually look for errors or hallucinations.<p>Traceloop is a monitoring platform that detects when your LLM app fails. Under the hood, we built real-time versions of known metrics like faithfulness, relevancy, redundancy, and many others. These are loosely based on some well-known NLP metrics that work well for LLM-generated texts. We correlate them with changes we detect in your system - like updates to prompts or to the model you’re using - to detect regressions automatically.<p>Here are some cool examples we’ve seen with our customers -<p>1. Applying our QA relevancy metric to an entity extraction task, we managed to discover issues where the model was not extracting the right entities (like an address instead of a person’s name); or returning random answers like “I’m here! What can I help you with today?”.<p>2. Our soft-faithfulness metric was able to detect cases in summarization tasks where a model was completely making up stuff that never appeared in the original text.<p>One of the challenges we faced was figuring out how to collect the data that we need from our customers&#x27; LLM apps. That’s where OpenTelemetry came in handy. We built OpenLLMetry (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;traceloop&#x2F;openllmetry"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;traceloop&#x2F;openllmetry</a>), and announced it here almost a year ago. It standardized the use of OpenTelemetry to observe LLM apps. We realized that the concepts of traces, spans, metrics, and logs that were standardized with OpenTelemetry can easily extend to gen AI. We partnered with 20+ observability platforms to make sure that OpenLLMetry becomes the standard for GenAI observability and that the data that we collect can be sent to other platforms as well.<p>We plan to extend the metrics we provide to support agents that use tools, vision models, and other amazing developments in our fast-paced industry.<p>We invite you to give Traceloop a spin and are eager for your feedback!

40972122,,story,sweca,2024-07-15 22:45:36,"Hey HN, I&#x27;m James, a 17-year old full-stack engineer from Canada with a strong passion for building software. During the day, I work for a California-based startup, and in the evenings, I enjoy working on side projects[1][2].<p>For the past 3 years, I&#x27;ve been building and iterating on a product I called Horizon Pics, which is a file hosting service, similar to mainstream services, like Imgur. Horizon allows you to quickly upload and store all types of files, from images and video, to PDFs and other documents. The biggest differentiating factor is that Horizon&#x27;s incentives are much more aligned with you, the end-user.<p>Unlike Imgur, Horizon has absolutely no ads, doesn&#x27;t sell your data, has built-in security and privacy controls, and is fully focused on your file sharing needs. No social media or other bloat.<p>This past week, I&#x27;ve launched a rebrand of Horizon which features a brand-new desktop app called Alpine[3], which serves as a local companion to Horizon. With it comes the capability to auto-upload screen captures and upload your clipboards as shareable pastes. For extra privacy, clipboard sharing can be automatically deleted after one view, or end-to-end encrypted with AES-256-GCM client-side. The desktop app is completely free to use! It&#x27;s powered by Tauri using TypeScript, SvelteKit, Sass, and Rust.<p>Horizon offers a free plan with limited storage and upload sizes, while the paid plan offers higher limits.<p>Let me know what you think about the landing page[0]. Does it provide enough information as a new user?<p>[0]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;horizon.pics"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;horizon.pics</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;httpjames.space"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;httpjames.space</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;httpjamesm"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;httpjamesm</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;horizon.pics&#x2F;alpine"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;horizon.pics&#x2F;alpine</a>",,,,"[40972972, 40972751, 40977110, 40974130, 40972889, 40972864, 40972974, 40973591, 40974335, 40973573, 40973976, 40972815, 40977095, 40975980, 40974152, 40973358, 40977843, 40997464, 40975452, 40972962, 41001637, 40973448, 40979089, 41002752, 40974019, 40972647, 40974003, 40980470, 40973161, 40973271, 40972852, 40977559, 40981960, 40977382, 40972823, 40972913, 40975111, 40987262, 40980387, 40993806, 40974270, 40972832, 40973554, 40974719, 40974627, 40973363, 40973761, 40977615, 40973427, 40973959, 40972752, 40974731, 40975845, 40977014, 40987784, 40972902, 40972999, 40973412, 40973373]",https://horizon.pics,359,Show HN: Horizon – Private alternative to Imgur,,202

I&#x27;ve had a wealth of experiences, both good and bad, but few have found their way into my mental models of how the world works, and so I keep making the same mistakes or am unable to effectively navigate my way to a specific goal.<p>From learning new topics &amp; skills, to learning how to network, to learning the dynamics of how an organization and how to navigate various relationships, to making well-reasoned and effective decisions, my mind often feels like mush, totally blinded to the realities of the world. I feel I&#x27;ve been stuck both cognitively and emotionally at a late-teen stage. Poor emotional regulation, difficulties with thinking in nuanced details, constantly flying at 1000 feet.<p>The older I get with no improvement, the more it feels my goals keep drifting farther away. I want to get fit, I want to read more, I want to develop skills, I want to build relationships, I want to be an entrepreneur. These are things many of my colleagues have been working towards for years. It feels like I just wasn&#x27;t given the playbook, and worse, am incapable of piecing one together.<p>Have any of you dealt with this? Any advice?

Currently we use a self-hosted Graylog setup, but are finding it difficult to maintain as our system grows.<p>Here&#x27;s our current setup:<p><pre><code>  - Multiple clusters
  - Logs aggregated to a single Graylog setup, itself running in Kubernetes
  - Logs are sent to Graylog via Fluentbit

</code></pre>
Some problems we&#x27;ve had are:<p><pre><code>  - Index management in Graylog&#x27;s ElasticSearch cluster is a PITA when you have many differently shaped log forms going to shared indices (managing separate indices per source is also a pain)
  - Management of MongoDB in Kubernetes is frustrating and has been a reliability challenge
</code></pre>
I&#x27;d love for us to be able to use a hosted logging solution but $$$ obviously. I&#x27;m aware of many other alternatives, but one of the things I&#x27;ve painfully learned is that a basic feature matrix only tells a very small piece of any story. The real education comes from running this type of tech and living with it through scale and various lifecycle events.<p>Some questions I have:<p><pre><code>  - What logging solutions are you using in your Kubernetes environment, and how has your experience been?
  - How do you handle log retention and storage costs?

I couldn&#x27;t walk or take care of myself for most of a year, and the recovery was extremely difficult. A fantastic 15+ year systems development career to came to an abrupt halt after my company was acquired while I was on medical leave, and I found myself without work to return to. Shortly after, I separated from my partner of 20 years, giving her and my son our family home and opting to stay for a while alone in a Dodge Ram van. Unfortunately my van was stolen at gunpoint, along with everything I owned, and I have been homeless on the streets of Tacoma, WA for the past 2 years.<p>I&#x27;m mentally and physically ready to get back to work, but it is difficult navigating this challenge without a computer or a roof over my head. I&#x27;m an adept hacker, having won a black badge in CTF at Defcon. I specialize in build and release automation, and am comfortable wearing any hat as long as I am writing code.<p>I&#x27;m hoping for advice, help, or maybe even an interview or contract offer from someone in a position to offer me a chance. I&#x27;m a tenacious, thoughtful and creative developer that excels at solving intractable problems and quickly resolving critical issues.<p>I still try to read HN every day, write code, and stay up on the latest and greatest tech. Walking is still a challenge, but the rest of me works just fine. Please let me know if you have any help or advice to offer. Thanks kindly.<p>Brandon

Claude knows how to use vim! And... you can do anything(!) from vim.<p>Turns out, embedding Claude in vim means you get a fully agentic AI pair programmer in &lt;1000 LoC. (See the GitHub README for examples of what &quot;fully agentic&quot; means.) And if you have some semantic vim tools (jedi.vim, eclim, ...) set up, Claude could use them if instructed.<p>Unlike CLIs, you can review Claude&#x27;s changes, and keep the chat history. So an editor interface is the killer feature for real work.<p>Sonnet 3.5 won&#x27;t take your programmer job yet. But it can make you a lot faster, even if you type very fast (especially its one-shot ability is amazing). The trick is not to give up thinking and stay in charge. Just let it do the grunt work.<p>P.S. I literally never wrote anything in vimscript before claude.vim. Thankfully, Claude did 95% of the code grunt work for me, most of the time already self-hosted.<p>P.P.S. Claude is on AWS Bedrock, chances are you can use it even in environments where sending code to random 3rd-party SaaS is a no-no.",,,,[41005613],https://github.com/pasky/claude.vim,11,Show HN: Claude.vim – a different take on AI pair programming,,1
